# Shadow JAM

# Project Abandoned ‚ò†Ô∏è
This project is no longer being developed. If you are looking for a toolkit to build **super lightweight websites** then I would highly suggest taking a look at https://www.11ty.io/ and https://sapper.svelte.technology/. You get everything out of the box that this project was aiming at doing for smaller websites with a payload size of JS that this project would never be able to reach. If you are looking to build **rich data intensive applications** I would highly suggest taking a look at https://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/ or https://github.com/Day8/re-frame which is a much easier to get started with in CLJS and more employable framework. 


### Starter (Not Production Ready)

A JAMstack build tool for developing PWA's with Clojurescript. This build tool is focused on capturing Better Web Practices.

- Better Performance
- Better Accessibility
- Better Developer Experience
- Better Project Completion Times

Demo at https://shadow-jam-starter.netlify.com/

Bootstrapped using the [Browser Quickstart](https://github.com/shadow-cljs/quickstart-browser.git) for Shadow CLJS

Inspiration & Prior art:
GatsbyJS, Next, Preact-cli, SapperJS

## Goals

- Follow the [PRPL](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) pattern
- 100/100 on Lighthouse audits out of the box
- Work well as a JAMstack template on Netlify

## Required Software

- [node.js (v10.3.0+)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Java JDK (10+)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or [Open JDK (10+)](http://jdk.java.net/10/)

## Running the Build Tool

Clone the repository. Then `cd` into it.

```bash
npm install
npx shadow-cljs server
```

This runs the `shadow-cljs` server process which all following commands will talk to. Just leave it running and open a new terminal to continue.

The first startup takes a bit of time since it has to download all the dependencies and do some prep work. Once this is running we can get started.

```txt
shadow-cljs run jam/watch
```

This will begin the compilation of the configured `:app` build and re-compile whenever you change a file.

To do a production release. Stop the `watch` process. Set up your service worker by running.

```txt
npx workbox wizard --injectManifest
```

Then run.

```txt
shadow-cljs run jam/release
```

Now the same url will have a production release that can be used for testing locally eg. Chrome Lighthouse Audits.

# Why PWA's?

Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on the user's home screen, without the need for an app store
https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/

The browser can do a lot. It has a high level of device integration (https://whatwebcando.today/) and with Web Assembly (reportedly running at 1.2x native code execution) it will be able to do a lot more in the future.

They are also installable on Desktop with Chrome right now. https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/dpwa

  - SpeedIndex < 1250
  - TTI < 5s on 3G
  - Critical file size budget < 170Kb.
  - The first 14~15Kb of the HTML is the most critical payload chunk

### Typography

- A¬†great write up on why font sizes should be bigger - https://blog.marvelapp.com/body-text-small/

- Variable fonts allows multiple font style variations with a single font file - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/typography/variable-fonts/

- More people change their font size in the browser than use edge - https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773

- How to set up a System font stack so you can leverage the fonts already available on the system - https://woorkup.com/system-font/

  - system-ui value for font-family has 84.06% global compatibility

  - Lean towards super font families when using Google fonts etc to ensure text can be read in the maximum number of languages

### Accessibility

Disabled Javascript

## Interesting developments with React

- Using React Suspense to reduce placeholders and **remove ReactDOM** from bundle - https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=851&v=z-6JC0_cOns
- Using Prepack to generate HTML: **React and ReactDOMServer are completely compiled away** - https://github.com/trueadm/ssr-with-prepack-hackathon

## TODO

- ‚úÖ Pre-render HTML
- ‚úÖ Inline critical CSS
- üõ† Optionally subset Google Fonts (possible to subset local fonts with more dependencies)
  - ‚úÖ Works for index HTML on release when true in config
- ‚úÖ Use lazysizes for lazy loading images
- ‚úÖ Local image manipulation using [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) in a similar way to [gatsby-transformer-sharp](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - Optionally inline if under 10kb as Data URI Gatsby does
- üõ† Generate Service Workers using Workbox
- Setup HTTPS for Shadow-cljs
- Use [Hicada](https://github.com/rauhs/hicada) instead of Sablono to provide new features
- Optionally run Lighthouse audits on public pages locally
- Option to create static websites that have either no JS, minimal JS or the React Runtime
- Automatic code splitting for routes
- Assess Guess JS integration
- Assess DataURI optimisations for SVG with mini-svg-data-uri
- Process images using [SQIP](https://github.com/technopagan/sqip) to generate SVG's in a similar way to [Gatsby SQIP plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-sqip/?=sqip).
  - Use 'svgo' to optimise the SVG if necessary
  - Use 'mini-svg-data-uri' on static images above the fold and inline into HTML.
